# KeyLoggerProject

This project is a key logger. When running, it records every key pressed on the keyboard by the user and writes it into a txt file. 

This project is for educational purposes. I worked on it because I found that it was the simplest cyber security project for beginners. 


## Future Improvements

Some features to add on to this project in the future:
1. auto email txt file after a certain amount of time 
2. automatically screenshot after a certain amount of time and save image
